# what on earth

yeah i'm not a unity person or a frontend person. but i had this thought, "what's one thing i absolutely can't do, shouldn't do in golang" and the immediate answer i had was "build a first person shooter." so naturally i decided to try to do that. not so much the "shooty" part, but i want to procedurally generate stuff through a websocket talking to golang and then use unity to render that (because Go *could* do that, but it wouldn't be pretty).

anyways, this is just the bad idea of the week, i'm not so sure how seriously anyone should take it. and unity absolutely destroys my laptop battery so i probably won't be working on this a whole lot right now.
